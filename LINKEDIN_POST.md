**I built SkillFade - a skill tracking app that tells you uncomfortable truths.**

Most learning apps reward you with badges and streaks. SkillFade does the opposite. It shows you:

- How your skills are decaying without practice
- That you're consuming more than you're creating
- Which skills you've studied but never actually used

It's a mirror, not a coach.

**Why I built this:**

As developers, we constantly learn new technologies. But how much do we actually retain? I realized I had dozens of "skills" I'd watched tutorials on but never applied. They were fading away.

**Key features:**

- Freshness algorithm that calculates skill decay over time
- Input/output balance tracking (learning vs practice)
- Practice scarcity detection for skills you've only studied
- Calm email alerts (no push notifications, no urgency)
- Self-hosted, privacy-first, no third-party analytics

**Tech stack:**
FastAPI + React + TypeScript + PostgreSQL + TailwindCSS

**What it's NOT:**
- No gamification (no points, badges, streaks)
- No AI recommendations
- No social features
- No judgment - just data

Would love to hear your thoughts on skill retention and how you track your learning journey.

## Alternative Shorter Version

**Introducing SkillFade - because your skills are fading and you might not know it.**

I built an app that tracks skill decay, practice gaps, and learning-to-practice imbalance.

No gamification. No badges. No streaks.

Just honest data about whether you're actually retaining what you learn.

Built with FastAPI, React, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. Self-hosted and privacy-first.

A mirror, not a coach.
